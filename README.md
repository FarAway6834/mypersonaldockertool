# mypersonaldockertool
using PyPI mydockertool package much better in docker by PyPI mypersonaldockeruse, and also it deploy as snap &amp; apt with build-essential &amp; python also deploy as docker 2 use much better.

## umm
deploy apt with docker is common right?.. well... I hope this pkg dosen't make problem.
I am little bit... nah, some... that worried about that pkg man (without pip) looks authoritative... so that it makes me nervers

well... using pip with apt isn't common? I think that it look common nah I don't know..
